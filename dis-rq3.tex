\section{Result Discussion RQ3}
For the third and final research question, the objective was to assess how the AI generated emotion labels obtained through the speech-based and text-based emotion recognition would compare to the self-reported emotions provided by the interviewees.

\subsection{Interpretation of Results}
In examining the alignment with the speech-based emotion labels from Hume AI and the text-based emotion labels from NLP Cloud with the self-assessed emotion scores, insightful findings revealed some levels of alignment dependent on both the model and emotion.
