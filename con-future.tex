\section{Future Research}
\label{sec:con-future}
There are several ways to build on this study for future research. 
Key areas for further advancement are a bigger dataset and a bigger set of emotions and vocal features. Using more emotions and vocal features can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of complex emotions such as confusion or boredom, or even blended emotions.
This, combined with a bigger and more diverse dataset from real word scenarios, could give robust data and insight in how emotions are recognized in linguistic data, important for future contributions for this field in the future such as in mental health monitoring etc.

A possible valuable direction for future research is to apply and try out emotion-recognition systems in real time settings and environments to provide scientifically justified insights, though this should be done with considerations for ethical implications and responsibility, specifically in sensitive areas involving mental health or similar.
